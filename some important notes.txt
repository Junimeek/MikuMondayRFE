I did not make any of the sprites that are featured in this mod. Everything made was made by whoever made them lmao

same goes for the original music

also, currently there are two unused/incomplete playable songs: ievan-polkka-tutorial, and kokoro. if you wanna play those, just add this code to the freeplay json [data\freeplaySongList.json]:
        
	{
            "songDatas": ["ievan-polkka-tutorial", "kokoro"],
            "songNames": ["Ievan Polkka Tutorial", "Kokoro"],
	    "diffs": [["EASY", "NORMAL", "HARD", "EXTREME"]],
            "weekNumber": 38,
            "characterIcons": ["miku", "album-kokoro"]
        }

	and check those commas after the } to make sure they're correct.
