# Miku Monday
This is a mod I've created for Friday Night Funkin' ReFunked Engine (https://github.com/pahaze/refunked).

Basically, it's miku, and uh, you sing against her, or something like that.

please dont download the source code, thats a mess, unless you like looking at my terrible code for some reason lmao

## Progress
Songs that are "officially" implemented:
- Melt [done]
- The World is Mine [done]
- Sakura no Ame [wip]
- Secret Police [wip]
- Rolling Girl [done]
- The Intense Voice of Hatsune Miku [done]

Other songs that exist in the game's source code, but has not been implemented yet:
- Love is War
- Romeo and Cinderella
- The secret garden
- The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku

Other features that I plan to add:
- Subtitles for every song
