## Important note
ReFunked Engine is currently undergoing a major code rewrite. As of right now, the latest build does **not** have the modding capabilities required to run this mod. Please be patient in waiting for new versions, as RFE is being worked on by one single guy who just codes in his almost-nonexistent free time.

If you don't want to wait tho, heres the link to the version required to run this mod: https://github.com/Junimeek/refunkedDocs/releases/tag/v0.99-an-2022-07-17

# Miku Monday
This is a mod I've created for Friday Night Funkin' ReFunked Engine.

Basically, it's miku, and uh, you sing against her, or something like that.

The source code hosted here is basically meaningless; for all intents and purposes, the mod files themselves are the source code.

## Progress
Songs that are "officially" implemented:
- Melt [done; being reworked]
- The World is Mine [done]
- Sakura no Ame [done]
- Romeo and Cinderella [only HARD chart is done]
- Rolling Girl [done]
- The Intense Voice of Hatsune Miku [done]

Other songs that exist in the mod's github source, but has not been implemented yet:
- Love is War
- Secret Police
- The secret garden
- The Disappearance of Hatsune Miku

Other features that I plan to add:
- Subtitles for every song
- Rework of all existing boyfriend vocals
